###### Some example code to help jump start new fish plugins.
###### This code does the not so easy task of copying files with their unknown directory structure.

### Set the base directory that we want directories and files copied into on the remote server.
### Normally this will be into $XDG_CONFIG_HOME which is set by default by xxh to:
### $HOME/.xxh/.config
#set basedirectorytocopyfilesto $XDG_CONFIG_HOME

### Makes a directory if it is not found.
#function mkdirifnotfound
#    mkdir -p "$basedirectorytocopyfilesto/$founddirectory"
#end

### Set files then copy them. By default is this the files in the "fish" directory,
### that would normally be found in ~/.config/fish
#set filestocopy "fish"
#for found in (find "$filestocopy" -depth -print)
#    if test -f "$found"
#      set founddirectory (dirname "$found")
#      mkdirifnotfound
#      cp "$found" "$basedirectorytocopyfilesto/$founddirectory/"
#    else
#      mkdirifnotfound
#    end
#end
